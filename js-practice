//Complete the instructions for each numbered problem. Each numbered problem is worth 10 points

//1. data types, built-in methods, variables
/*
    7 Data Types: Number, String, Boolean, Null, undefined, Symbol, Object
    Methods return information about an object, and are called by appending an instance with a period, method name and parentheses.
    A variable is a container for data that is stored in computer memory.  Variable keywords: var, let, const.
*/
//a. define a variable and give it a string value

    let myText = "Hello";

//b. define a variable and give it a number value

    let myNum = 15;
    //comment

//c. define a variable and give it a boolean value

    let myBoolean= true;

//2. if else, ternary
//a. define a variable 'metrocard' and give it a value of 5

    const metrocard = 5;

//b. write an if statement that has a condition to check if the value of metro card is greater than 2.75, and display the message "you have enough to ride the train", if the condition is true

    if (metrocard > 2.75) {console.log('you have enough to ride the train');}

//c.write an else statement that displays the message "you do not have enough to pay fare sorry"

    else {console.log('you do not have enough to pay fare sorry');}

//d. write the above if/else statement again as a ternary

    const metrocard = 5;
    if (metrocard > 2.75) {console.log('you have enough to ride the train');}
    else {console.log('you do not have enough to pay fare sorry');}

//3. conditionals 2 (1 pt)
//a.  complete this codecademy project: https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/projects/magic-eight-ball-1
//add a screenshot showing your completion of this project to the root folder of this repo

    //added

//4. functions
//a. write a function named helloWorld that returns the value 'Hello World!'

    function helloWorld(){
        console.log('Hello World!')
    };

//b. console log the value returned from running the function helloWorld

    'Hello World!'

//3. arrays
//a. define a variable myArray and assign it to a value of an array. Give the array at least 5 elements

    let myArray = [1,2,3,4,5];

//b. an array's index starts at:

    0 

//4. loops
//a. write a for loop that console logs even numbers starting at 10 and decrementing to 0

    for(let number = 11; number >= 0; number -= 2) {
      console.log(number); 
    }

//5. objects
//a. define a variable named 'bike'

    let bike

//b. assign an object to bike

    let bike = bicycle

//c. give the object 3 properties: handlebars, color, wheels

    => { bicycle = {
        (handlebars, color, wheels)
        }
        };

//d. give each property a value

    => {
        return{
        handlebars: 2,
        color: 'black',
        wheels: 4,
                };
    };

//6. Chessboard
//Write a function that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. 
    //At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

    var chessboard = "";

        for (let i = 1; i <= size; i++) {
            for (let n = 1; n <= size; n++) {
                if ((i + n) % 2 == 0) {
                    board += " ";
                } else { 
                    board += "#";
                     }
                    }
             board += "\n"; 
        }
    console.log(chessboard);

/*Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8.
